# misc
Misc is a community wiki to track many things, implemented in a git repo of markdown files. It's pribarily run by one guy, the only guy who cares. It's arranged like this so I can track all of the things I'm interested in, and maybe other people can help as well, without creating a billion dedicated wikis or whatever. To contribute, you must make an account on github (this is easy) and do a pull request on this repo (this is also easy). All told, it shouldn't be harder than contributing to a regular wiki, for you at least, and this way the wiki will never go down due to software updates or hosting costs (feel free to clone this repo on your main as well.

## a tale of woe

Having lived in this world for a while, I have become interested in various things, and people. Say I'm interested in some artist and they occasionally appear on podcasts. That's great! I like hearing what they have to say, they have great insights; so I'd like to listen to every podcast they appear on. Should be easy, right? If they care about their legacy or their fans, surely they have some easy list somewhere of everything they've done? Alas, no.

Here are various strategies for dealing with this problem (the latter three basically being different flavors of the same thing):

1. The person themself keeps a good record of everything they've ever done. This has obvious intuitive appeal, but most people are not bothering!! Even if they have a website, it's usually token ("I'm X and I do Y, here's a picture of me") or incomplete ("here are the actual things I've done, not including my podcast appearences, which I don't think are interesting.
2. Some reddit community or something keeps a record of everything the person has ever done. This sometimes works, but it's a fragile system, and requires digging. If there aren't enough fans of this guy then I might be constantly searching youtube and current web results to stay on top of this interesting person's activity.
3. Some community of scholars academically interested in the subject passively knows all of the things the person has ever done. Maybe eventually a list of theirs makes it onto wikipedia if it's "notable" enough. (This wikipedia solution also works well if you're interested in, say, all of the comedy specials of a comedian, which are always considered notable enough)
4. (YOU ARE HERE) I make a list myself.

These are not secret things, by the way; I'm not doxxing anyone. These are public appearences and materials, meant for public consumption; just not put in any sort of useful list. So, instead of pleading to each one to do it individually, I figured I could just do it myself.

## misc notes on Misc

Unfortunately, this system is not perfect either. In fact, there's a good chance I won't actually bother to do any of this.

Commentary in my Misc is encouraged and normal. I'm cogitating on ways to make this collapsible so that the commentary upon items does not overwhelm the items. Having the items be very readable, and the list be as tractible as possible, is very important. I might also notate whether or not I've watched a certain thing, and my personal feelings upon it. This solution, alas, will not scale to anyone else, which is a shame and makes me think I need a different solution.

There's obviously a conflict here because I should store all of the things referenced in here to avoid link rot, but github file size limits and copyright concerns might stop me. Also, it would be more work.

I'm always trying to avoid work, because this means I can do more of them.

It is unlikely that these will show up usefully in search engine results, which is a shame.

I ask that you don't hold the fact that every artist will have like a million unfinished projects in a list against them. This is true of ALMOST EVERYONE. Everyone has something they think they might get around to one day, or some abandoned concept.

I started this repo in 2024-08-26 and I probably won't be backfilling it unfortunately. But you're free to contribute backfilling if you like.

Ideally you should be able to subscribe to these pages as rss?
